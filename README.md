## Code Metrics

If you want information about passed tests, test coverage, and linting, you can do so by creating a merge request. The
merge request will then contain the desired information:

![Merge-Request](attachments/merge-request.png)

As long as the merge request title begins with `Draft:`, it will not be merged. The test coverage can be viewed in the
diff (click on changes):

A line that has a hit or is just a definition:

A line that is untested:
